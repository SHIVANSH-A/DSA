Dynamic Programming

i)Overlapping problem (Recursion)

Certain values are recomputed many times which overlaps that can be stored
ex-Fibonacci
              f(5)
         ↙    ↘
      f(4)   f(3)
      ↙  ↘
   f(3)=2 f(2)
   ↙   ↘
f(2)=1  f(1)
↙   ↘
f(1) f(0)
Like in this case f(2),f(3) is computed one time but f(4) will again call f(2) and it will again call subsequent functions.
That's Overlapping.

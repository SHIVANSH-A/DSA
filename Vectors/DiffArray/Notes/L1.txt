1)Used for multiple range updates
2)Used to update multi entries in constant time
ex- arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
    q = [[1,3,3],[1,2,3]]
    for q [1,3,3] - From index 1 to 3 add 3 (same for other queries)
    O(q*n)

Intution
If we take starting index correct
    l = Starting index
    r = last index
    Then operation will be done in all indexes after l.
    Then redo operation after r.
    Then if we take cumulative sum then we get correct arr
[l,r,x] - arr[l]+=x
          arr[r+1]-=x (r+1<n)
          Then cumu. sum
          O(q+n)
(Segment tree can be used)

Bellman Ford
1)Used to find shortest path from src to given node
2)Can be used with Directed graph with negative edges
3)For undirected graph convert it to directed (No negative edge)
4)Can detect negative cycles


Concept  - i) If all the edges will be relaxed V-1 times the path obtained will be shortest
ii)Relax  - less costly path is obtained

Code  - O(E*V)
    for(int i=1;i<=V-1;i++){
        for(auto &edge:edges){
            int u=edge[0];
            int v=edge[1];
            int wt=edge[2];

            if(r[u]!=INT_MAX && r[u]+wt<r[v]){
                r[v]=r[u]+wt;
            }

        }
    }
